![Binomial Probability Formula](https://www.gstatic.com/education/formulas/images_long_sheet/en/binomial_distribution_formula.svg)
To calculate a probability (or cumulative probabilities) of a binomial problem, this program accepts inputs of:

 - p (probability of single-trial success)
 - n (number of trials)
 - x (number of times for a specific outcome within trials)

### Constraints

- 0 ≤ p ≤ 1
- n, x > 0
- x ≤ n
- n,x is whole number
